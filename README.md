Flood Prediction Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning

Overview

This project aims to predict flood risks using satellite imagery and machine learning techniques, including XGBoost for classification and K-means clustering for data analysis. By analyzing various features derived from satellite data, we can enhance flood prediction accuracy and facilitate timely responses to potential flood events. This repository contains the data processing scripts, model training code, and a user-friendly interface for real-time flood risk assessment.
